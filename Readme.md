## Reporting issues
We use GitHub Issues as our official bug tracker. We strive to keep this a clean, maintainable and searchable record of our open and closed bugs, therefore we kindly ask you to obey some rules before reporting an issue:

1. Make sure the report is accompanied by a reproducible demo.
* Always add information on what browser it applies to, and other information needed for us to debug.
* It may be that the bug is already fixed. Try your editor with our latest work from https://github.com/stefanneculai/froala-wysiwyg/tree/master/js before reporting.
* For feature requests, tech support and general discussion, don't use GitHub Issues. See [http://editor.froala.com/contact](editor.froala.com/contact) for the appropriate channels.
